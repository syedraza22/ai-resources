### Tools 

#### Vector Databases 
* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io). Open source tool, databases for AI applications  

#### Building LLM Apps 
* [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/). Open source tool that provides data connectors, application integration, data indexes and data agents 
* [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com). Open source tools for creating chains and agents using LLM. Template notebooks [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/templates).
* [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/). Building multi-agent networks. Open source tools for creating agents or multi-agent using LLM. See examples [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/notebook). 

#### Model Platforms
* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), Prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and assistants. Explore and build your custom GPT with no-code [here](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/discovery) OR use your own [developer](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
* [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
* [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), Model marketplace and model serving, HF provides access to open-source models like [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf), and you can also explore community generated spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces).

#### Low code platforms
* [AWS PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws), Prompt engineering, and assistants. Build AI apps with no code
* [Predibase](https://predibase.com), low/no code platform for finetuning and serving 

#### Evaluations
* [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals). Open source evaluation framework for LLMs, it aims to make it as simple as possible to build an eval while writing as little code as possible. An "eval" is a task used to evaluate the quality of a system's behavior. 

#### Visualization and Frontend
* [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/). Easy to use frontend and UI in Python. Ideas from the [community](https://streamlit.io/generative-ai).
* Taipy

#### Observability & Monitoring
* [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/), Monitoring and observability. Monitoring layer for API usage
